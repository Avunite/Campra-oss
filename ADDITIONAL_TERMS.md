# Additional Terms - Infrastructure and Trademark Restrictions

**Effective Date:** January 11, 2026  
**Governed by:** Avunite

---

## Important Legal Notice

This document does NOT modify or restrict the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0) under which this software is licensed. You have full AGPL-3.0 rights to use, modify, distribute, and even sell this software.

These terms only govern:
1. Access to Avunite's proprietary infrastructure
2. Use of the "Campra" name and logos
3. Attribution requirements for Avunite's contributions

---

## 1. Infrastructure Access Restrictions

**Avunite-operated Campra network infrastructure is proprietary and access-restricted.**

**Important:** Campra does NOT support federation. It is a centralized platform.

Self-hosted instances of this software:
- ❌ Cannot connect to Campra's official network
- ❌ Cannot access Campra's centralized services, APIs, or infrastructure
- ❌ Cannot use Campra's discovery services or directories
- ❌ Cannot federate with Campra or other instances (federation not supported)
- ✅ CAN operate as independent, standalone installations

**Rationale:** This restricts access to OUR servers and infrastructure, not the software itself. You are free to deploy your own instance, but Avunite's network is a separate service.

---

## 2. Trademark and Branding Restrictions

The "Campra" name and associated branding are trademarks of Avunite.

Self-hosted instances:
- ❌ Cannot represent themselves as "official Campra" instances
- ❌ Cannot imply endorsement or affiliation with Avunite
- ✅ CAN identify the software as "based on Campra"
- ✅ MUST clearly indicate they are independent, self-hosted installations
- ✅ SHOULD use a different name/brand for public-facing services

**Rationale:** This protects our trademark, not software freedoms. Similar to how you can't call your Linux distribution "Red Hat" without permission.

---

## 3. Selling Services Clarification

**The AGPL-3.0 explicitly allows you to sell this software and related services.** We cannot and do not restrict that right.

However, be aware:
- ✅ You CAN sell hosting, support, or custom development services
- ✅ You CAN charge for your own instance
- ❌ You CANNOT sell access to Avunite's official Campra network (you don't have permission)
- ❌ You CANNOT misrepresent your service as being operated by Avunite

## 5. This is NOT a "Free Campra" Substitute

- Support open-source development of related projects (Barkle, Calckey)
- Comply with AGPL-3.0 requirements for Calckey derivatives
- Provide transparency for the V1 codebase

### About Campra V2 (Future)

**Avunite is migrating to Campra V2**, which will feature:
- Completely new frontend and backend (NOT based on Calckey or Barkle)
- Proprietary, closed-source codebase
- Will NOT be released as open source
- Enhanced features and official support

### This Repository is NOT:
- A way to get "free" access to Avunite's Campra platform (V1 or V2)
- A commercially-supported product
- An officially-maintained Campra service
- Representative of Campra V2's capabilities

**If you want the full Campra experience with official network access, support, and infrastructure, please visit Avunite's commercial offerings.**
